I'm a third-year undergraduate student from [Stony Brook College of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ceas/), Stony Brook University.  
My research interests include **AI for Science**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Generative Models**.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Professor Yi Liu](https://jacoblau0513.github.io/) from Stony Brook University.

You can find my CV here: [Yichi Zhang's Curriculum Vitae](..YichiXiaoju/YichiZhang.github.io/assets/Yichi_Zhang_CV.pdf).
