I'm a third-year undergraduate student from [Stony Brook College of Engineering and Applied Sciences](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/ceas/), Stony Brook University.  
My research interests lie at the intersection of **AI for Science**, **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, and **Generative Models**.  
Specifically, I focus on leveraging LLMs for **molecular optimization** and **drug editing**, investigating how language-based models can understand and manipulate chemical structures through SMILES, SELFIES, or graph-based prompts. I am also interested in generative approaches that can propose novel molecules with desirable properties under complex constraints.

I view **LLMs and generative models as foundational tools in the future of scientific discovery**. LLMs can encode massive domain knowledge and enable zero-shot reasoning over symbolic and structured scientific data. Meanwhile, generative models—especially diffusion-based and autoregressive architectures—offer a principled way to explore chemical and physical design spaces, opening new doors for molecule generation, materials design, and reaction planning. I believe the synergy of these two paradigms will help build intelligent scientific assistants that can hypothesize, simulate, and even iterate with humans in the loop.

I am currently preparing to apply for **Ph.D. or M.S. programs for Fall 2026**, aiming to pursue research in machine learning with applications to molecular design, scientific discovery, and automated reasoning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Professor Yi Liu](https://jacoblau0513.github.io/) from Stony Brook University.
